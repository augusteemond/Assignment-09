1.) Overall I find html really cool to work with. Almost all of it is new to me, but the more I work with it the more I find myself becomming more fluent with it. A problem that I still face is incoorperating the Images file into my actual html page.
2.) Becasue I am still not too fluent with html at the current moment I am a little anxious to jump into CSS but non the less very exicted. I find coding really enjoyable because it is something completely new to me and is challanging.
3.) I finially figured out how to preview my actual web pages so I can know what they look like as a website. Which is really nice because it helps me orient the correct edits I need to make in my code in order to have a clean fluent web page. The only road block I am currently faceing is relating my images folder to my html page. Other than that I would say that things are running quite smoothly.
